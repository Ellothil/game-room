# Game Room Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game with real-time gameplay using WebSocket communication. The application now supports the full game lifecycle from room discovery to game completion.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Room Management
- **Conditional Rendering**: Gallery component now switches to Room view when a user joins a room
- **Player List Display**: Room cards in the gallery show all players currently in each lobby
- **Centralized Socket Connection**: Socket.IO connection moved to `App.tsx` to maintain the same connection across view transitions
- **State Tracking**: Added `currentRoom` to the room store to track which room the user is currently in

### 2. Game State Management
- **Game Store** (`client/src/stores/game-store.ts`): Created a Zustand store for managing Tic-Tac-Toe game state
  - Board state (9 cells)
  - Current player tracking
  - Player symbol assignment (X or O)
  - Winner detection
  - Game status (waiting, playing, finished)
  - Move validation logic with winner checking algorithm

### 3. Backend Game Logic
- **Game State Tracking**: Server maintains game states for all active rooms
- **Game Start Handler**: Validates room has 2 players and assigns symbols (X and O)
- **Move Handler**: 
  - Validates player turns
  - Checks move validity
  - Detects winners using pattern matching
  - Broadcasts moves to all players in the room
- **Winner Detection**: Checks all 8 possible winning patterns (3 rows, 3 columns, 2 diagonals)
- **Game Cleanup**: Removes game state when game ends or players disconnect

### 4. WebSocket Events (Shared Types)
Added new game-specific events:
- **Server → Client**:
  - `game:start` - Notifies all players game has started with their assigned symbols
  - `game:move` - Broadcasts moves to all players with updated board state
  - `game:end` - Announces game winner or draw
  - `game:error` - Reports game-related errors (invalid moves, not your turn, etc.)

- **Client → Server**:
  - `game:start` - Request to start game (only when room is full)
  - `game:move` - Submit a move to the server

### 5. UI Components

#### Gallery Component Updates (`client/src/features/gallery/gallery.tsx`)
- Displays player names in each room card
- Shows player count (e.g., "2/2")
- Dynamic button text ("Join Room", "Room Full", "Already Joined")
- Conditional rendering: Shows Room component when user joins a room
- Removed redundant socket connection (now handled in App.tsx)

#### Room Component Updates (`client/src/features/room/room.tsx`)
- Shows waiting state when game hasn't started
- Displays "Start Game" button when room is full
- Integrates Tic-Tac-Toe board component during gameplay
- Shows player list with current user highlighted
- Turn indicator to show whose turn it is

#### Tic-Tac-Toe Board Component (`client/src/features/game/tic-tac-toe.tsx`)
- 3x3 grid of interactive cells
- Visual feedback for clickable cells (hover effects)
- Displays player's assigned symbol (X or O)
- Turn indicator ("Your turn" vs "O's turn")
- Optimistic UI updates (immediate feedback before server confirmation)
- Game over state with winner announcement
- Prevents invalid moves (occupied cells, wrong turn, game not started)

### 6. App-Level Integration (`client/src/app.tsx`)
- **Centralized Socket Management**: All WebSocket listeners in one place
- **Game Event Handling**:
  - Starts game in store when server broadcasts game:start
  - Updates board state on each move
  - Handles game end with toast notifications
  - Shows error messages for invalid actions
- **Room Event Handling**: Updates room list and current room state
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for all major events

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality
- Fixed lint errors by extracting magic numbers to constants
- Reduced code complexity by breaking down functions
- Used proper TypeScript types throughout
- Avoided array index as React keys (replaced with semantic keys)
- Followed Ultracite rules (no nested ternaries, proper arrow functions)

### Architecture Benefits
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Game state managed in Zustand store
2. **Real-time Sync**: All players see moves instantly via WebSocket broadcasts
3. **Optimistic Updates**: UI responds immediately, syncs with server
4. **Error Handling**: Server validates all moves, prevents cheating
5. **Clean Separation**: UI, state management, and networking are decoupled

## User Flow

1. **Sign In** → User authenticates
2. **Gallery** → User sees list of available rooms with player counts
3. **Join Room** → User clicks "Join Room" button
4. **Lobby** → User sees players in the room, waits for room to fill
5. **Start Game** → Any player can start when room has 2 players
6. **Gameplay** → Players take turns clicking cells on the board
7. **Game End** → Winner is announced, players can leave room
8. **Return to Gallery** → User can join another room

## Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `client/src/stores/game-store.ts` - Game state management
- `client/src/features/game/tic-tac-toe.tsx` - Game board UI component
- `shared/websocket/types.ts` - Added game event types

### Modified
- `server/src/websocket/socket.ts` - Added game logic handlers
- `client/src/app.tsx` - Centralized socket connection and game event listeners
- `client/src/stores/room-store.ts` - Added currentRoom tracking
- `client/src/features/gallery/gallery.tsx` - Added conditional rendering and player list
- `client/src/features/room/room.tsx` - Integrated game UI and controls

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. **Multiple Rooms**: Add more predefined game rooms
2. **Other Games**: Implement Connect Four, Chess, etc.
3. **Rematch Feature**: Allow players to start a new game without leaving room
4. **Spectator Mode**: Let users watch ongoing games
5. **Game History**: Track and display past games
6. **Animations**: Add visual effects for moves and wins
7. **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for moves and game events
8. **Chat**: In-game messaging between players
9. **Matchmaking**: Automatically pair players
10. **Ranked Play**: ELO rating system

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with two browsers/incognito windows
2. Verify moves sync between players
3. Test disconnect/reconnect scenarios
4. Verify turn validation works
5. Test all win conditions (rows, columns, diagonals)
6. Test draw condition (full board, no winner)
7. Verify error messages appear correctly
8. Test room joining restrictions

## Conclusion

The application now has a fully functional multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game with real-time synchronization, proper validation, and a polished user experience. The architecture is scalable and ready for adding more games and features.
